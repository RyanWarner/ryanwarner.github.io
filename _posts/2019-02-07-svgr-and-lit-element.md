I discovered a couple cool libraries today.

# [svgr](https://github.com/smooth-code/svgr)

Svgr converts svgs I export from Sketch into React components. It strips out all of the uncesseary code, something I was previously doing by hand ðŸ˜±I now do via the svgr CLI tool.

# [lit-element](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element)

LitElement seems like an innovative way to style my React apps. I haven't tried this first hand yet, but this is on my list of things to check back in on.

I was turned on to LitElement via this [tweet](https://twitter.com/justinfagnani/status/1093229305662889985)
